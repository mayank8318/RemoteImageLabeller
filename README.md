# RemoteImageLabeller
 A set of tools to label images in a team. Use the scripts in the Python folder to set up the databse on the server. After that, start the express app. Add users using POSTMAN or the mongo command shell.
 
Update the labelling options("a,b,c") with the labels required.

 ## TODO
 - \[ ] Shift everything to Mongo
 - \[ ] Add endpoints to extract all the labels in a CSV file.
 
 Feel free to contribute :)
